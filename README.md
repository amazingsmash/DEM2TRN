# Triangular Regular Networks Generator from Randomly Distributed Digital Elevation Models

Many times, specially in the realm of geographical visualization, vertical displacement maps need to be translated into coarser mesh models. One of the most typical mesh structures is the Triangular Regular Networks (TRN), meshes of rectangular triangles, evenly distributed in the XY plane.

This work presents a Matlab implementation of our algorithm to compute an optimally displaced TRN, achieved by minimising the geometrical error equation between the DEM and the mesh.
